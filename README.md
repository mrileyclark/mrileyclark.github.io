👋🏻 Hi, my name is Mary Clark. I became a web developer because I enjoy learning and challengeing myself. I am a resourceful and team-oriented 
individual passionate about my work. Check me out!

💻 The purpose of this file is to showcase my projects in a personal portfolio website. I began my front end web development journey 8 months ago.  I signed
up for Codecademy to begin my learning journey.
